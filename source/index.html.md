# Introduction

open-todo is an open-sourced platform focus on managing tasks conveniently, productively, and intelligently.

The current version of open-todo API is RESTful, meaning resource-oriented endpointes and respecting HTTP headers, status codes, verbs etc.

<aside class="notice">
open-todo is still in alpha phase.
</aside>

# Endpoint

The open-todo API endpoints is: `https://api.opentodo.io/`

<aside class="notice">HTTPS is essential.</aside>

# Authentication

## Account and Token

To access the open-todo API, you have to go create an account at [opentodo.io/account](https://opentodo.io/account), an `uid` and some `token`s will be assigned to you, which will be used for authentication.

<aside class="notice">
When creating an open-todo Account, we currently support sign in with Google. We will support more methods later.
</aside>

## Authentication with Header

Opentodo use `Basic authenticate scheme`. Unless otherwise noted, every request to open-todo have to include an header like `Authorization: Basic <credential>`.

In which the `<credential>` is composed like this:

1. Combine your uid and token as "uid:token" (`aladdin:opensesame`).
2. Encode the result via base64 (`YWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuc2VzYW1l`).

<aside class="notice">
For historical reasons, there maybe some newlines (<code>\n</code>) included in the result of default base64 encoding method.
You should use methods like <code>urlsafe_encode64</code>, <code>Base64.encodeBase64URLSafe</code> to get rid <code>\n</code>s in result.
